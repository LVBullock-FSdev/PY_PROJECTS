In-Class Challenge-Elements of a list to a file.

Write a Python program that writes the elements of a list to the file denoted by the variable file.
Each element should be written on a separate line.
The file should be new or its existing content must be replaced by this new content.
  Expected Output:
If this is the list:
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
After running the program, the content of the file should be:
1
2
3
4
5
  Hints:
â€¢	You will need to add a \n (new line) character to write the elements on separate lines.
